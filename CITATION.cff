  The Soil and Water Assessment Tool Plus (SWAT+) is a
  public domain model jointly developed by the USDA
  Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS) and Texas A&M
  AgriLife Research, part of The Texas A&M University
  System. SWAT+ is a small watershed to river basin-scale
  model to simulate the quality and quantity of surface and
  ground water and predict the environmental impact of land
  use, land management practices, and climate change. SWAT
  is widely used in assessing soil erosion prevention and
  control, non-point source pollution control and regional
  management in watersheds.
